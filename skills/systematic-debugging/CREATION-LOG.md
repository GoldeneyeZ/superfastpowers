# Creation Log: Systematic Debugging Skill

Reference example: extract, structure, bulletproof critical skill.

## Source Material

Extracted debugging framework from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
- 4-phase systematic process (Investigation → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis → Implementation)
- Core mandate: ALWAYS find root cause, NEVER fix symptoms
- Rules resist time pressure + rationalization

## Extraction Decisions

**What to include:**
- Complete 4-phase framework with all rules
- Anti-shortcuts ("NEVER fix symptom", "STOP and re-analyze")
- Pressure-proof language ("even if faster", "even if I seem in a hurry")
- Concrete phase steps

**What to leave out:**
- Project-specific context
- Repeated same-rule variants
- Narrative explanations (condensed to principles)

## Structure Following skill-creation/SKILL.md

1. **Rich when_to_use** - Symptoms + anti-patterns
2. **Type: technique** - Concrete process with steps
3. **Keywords** - "root cause", "symptom", "workaround", "debugging", "investigation"
4. **Flowchart** - Decision point for "fix failed" → re-analyze vs add more fixes
5. **Phase-by-phase breakdown** - Scannable checklist format
6. **Anti-patterns section** - What NOT to do (critical for this skill)

## Bulletproofing Elements

Framework resists pressure rationalization:

### Language Choices
- "ALWAYS" / "NEVER" (not "should" / "try to")
- "even if faster" / "even if I seem in a hurry"
- "STOP and re-analyze" (explicit pause)
- "Don't skip past" (catches actual behavior)

### Structural Defenses
- **Phase 1 required** - Can't skip to implementation
- **Single hypothesis rule** - Forces thinking, blocks shotgun fixes
- **Explicit failure mode** - "IF your first fix doesn't work" with mandatory action
- **Anti-patterns section** - Shows exact shortcut shapes

### Redundancy
- Root cause mandate in overview + when_to_use + Phase 1 + implementation rules
- "NEVER fix symptom" appears 4 times in different contexts
- Each phase has explicit "don't skip" guidance

## Testing Approach

Created 4 validation tests following skills/meta/testing-skills-with-subagents:

### Test 1: Academic Context (No Pressure)
- Simple bug, no time pressure
- **Result:** Perfect compliance, complete investigation

### Test 2: Time Pressure + Obvious Quick Fix
- User "in a hurry"; symptom fix looks easy
- **Result:** Resisted shortcut, followed full process, found real root cause

### Test 3: Complex System + Uncertainty
- Multi-layer failure; root cause unclear
- **Result:** Systematic investigation, traced all layers, found source

### Test 4: Failed First Fix
- Hypothesis doesn't work; temptation to add more fixes
- **Result:** Stopped, re-analyzed, formed new hypothesis (no shotgun)

**All tests passed.** No rationalizations found.

## Iterations

### Initial Version
- Complete 4-phase framework
- Anti-patterns section
- Flowchart for "fix failed" decision

### Enhancement 1: TDD Reference
- Added link to skills/testing/test-driven-development
- Note explaining TDD's "simplest code" ≠ debugging's "root cause"
- Prevents methodology confusion

## Final Outcome

Bulletproof skill:
- ✅ Clearly mandates root cause investigation
- ✅ Resists time pressure rationalization
- ✅ Provides concrete steps for each phase
- ✅ Shows anti-patterns explicitly
- ✅ Tested under multiple pressure scenarios
- ✅ Clarifies relationship to TDD
- ✅ Ready for use

## Key Insight

**Most important bulletproofing:** Anti-patterns section shows exact shortcuts that feel justified in moment. When Claude thinks "I'll just add this one quick fix", same pattern listed as wrong creates cognitive friction.

## Usage Example

When encountering bug:
1. Load skill: skills/debugging/systematic-debugging
2. Read overview (10 sec) - mandate reminder
3. Follow Phase 1 checklist - forced investigation
4. If tempted to skip - see anti-pattern, stop
5. Complete all phases - root cause found

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes
**Time saved:** Hours of symptom-whack-a-mole
